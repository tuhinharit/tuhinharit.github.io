<p>Mannu Rikshewala is a story of Mannu (the rikshewala), Ankita (the passenger) and Sameer (the commuter).</p>
<p>It explores the concept of a 'stranger’ which represent how deep within we're all the same: same raw material, same human being, same soul...</p>
<p>Mannu appears to be an ordinary rikshewala. He carries broken dreams in his lonely heart, dreams of rising above the creeping hunger and petty bargains for five-rupee-notes, every damn day of his life!
</p>
<p>Ankita leaves her diary in his rickshaw by mistake. Scribbled on its yellow pages is her soul, which candidly speaks to Mannu’s ailing heart. And just when he thinks he has found something like love, destiny puts him on a cruel cross-road.</p>
<p>Sameer, Ankita’s boyfriend has a plan for everything – even as he struggles to balance his love and aspirations. One fine day, he finds himself face-to-face with the crude reality of a funny world!
</p>
<p>While they are busy fighting life, fate delivers Ankita a checkmate. As the clock ticks on, Mannu is the only person that stands between Ankita and half-past-dead Ankita. And just like that, the two men have to make life-and-death decisions...</p>
