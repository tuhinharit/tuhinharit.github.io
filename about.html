<p>I was born in a middle class family in a small town of western Uttar Pradesh. Many of my childhood memories originate from congested roads and busy markets, and ubiquitous in these settings were thin, sweaty rikshewalas. From the passenger seat, I used to thoroughly enjoy having casual conversations with them. I loved to see them enter in an enthusiastic, often grumbling monologue, revealing carefully hidden secrets from the darkest crevices of society. These conversations, along with my first-hand observations during religious riots in my hometown, shaped my social and political views.

<p>Poems were my first love. I have been writing ever since I can remember. My short fiction story about a guy, a girl and an airplane, will soon appear in the Nov issue of the Muse magazine.</p>

<p>Apart from fiction, I also write about politics and macro-economics. My views on the Indian budget and renewable industry have been published by multiple publications.</p>

<p>I am an IIT (Roorkee) and ISB educated investment banker and live in Mumbai.</p>
